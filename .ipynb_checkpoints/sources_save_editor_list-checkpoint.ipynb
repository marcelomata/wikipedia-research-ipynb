September 28, 2000. BBC. \"Palestinians and Israeli police have clashed in the worst violence for several years at Jerusalem's holiest site, the compound around Al-Aqsa mosque. The violence began after a highly controversial tour of the mosque compound early this morning by hardline Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon. ... Soon after Mr Sharon left the site, the angry demonstrations outside erupted into violence. Israeli police fired tear gas and rubber-coated metal bullets, while protesters hurled stones and other missiles. Police said 25 of their men were hurt by missiles thrown by Palestinians, but only one was taken to hospital. Israel Radio reported at least three Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets. ... Following Friday [Sept 29, 2000] prayers the next day violence again broke out throughout Jerusalem and the West Bank.\"</ref>\n",

      "<ref><blockquote>\"The wave of terrorism that began in September 2000 is the direct result of a strategic Palestinian decision to use violence – rather than negotiation – as the primary means to advance their agenda....\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"Indeed, the current wave of terrorism began shortly after intense high-level negotiations were conducted to find a permanent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In July 2000, a Middle East peace summit was held at Camp David, hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton and attended by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak. During the summit, Israel expressed its willingness to make far-reaching and unprecedented compromises in order to arrive at a workable, enduring agreement. However, Yasser Arafat chose to break off the negotiations without even offering any proposals of his own. Consequently, the summit adjourned with President Clinton placing the blame for its failure squarely at Arafat's feet.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"It is clear that the current wave of Palestinian terrorism, which began in the wake of the Camp David summit failure, has nothing to do with a spontaneous Palestinian action to \"resist the occupation.\" The Palestinian leadership had taken a strategic decision to abandon the path to peace and to use violence as their primary tactic for advancing their agenda. This decision undermined the bedrock foundation of the peace process – the understanding that a solution can only be reached through compromise rather than inflexibility, and through negotiation rather than violence. The Palestinian claim that Israel's presence in the territories caused the terrorism began as a desperate attempt to deflect criticism after Arafat rejected Israel's peace proposals. It quickly evolved into an excuse for the inexcusable – the indiscriminate murder of innocent civilians.Terrorist attacks can never be justified, and they are particularly tragic when the disputed issues could have been settled through negotiations. The Palestinian Authority had been given a real opportunity to end the conflict through negotiations. However, Israel's olive branch was met with a hail of gunfire and a barrage of suicide bombers. The greatest obstacle to peace is not the lack of a Palestinian state, rather it is the existence of Palestinian terrorism.\"</blockquote>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/11/Israel-+the+Conflict+and+Peace-+Answers+to+Frequen+-+2003.htm#cause What caused the current wave of Palestinian terrorism?] by the [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]</ref>\n",

Born a Palestinian Arab in the Jerusalem city of Mandatory Palestine (1920–48), he was an American citizen through his father.“Between Worlds”, Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays (2002) p. 556. Said was an advocate for the political and the human rights of the Palestinian people, whom the journalist Robert Fisk described as their most powerful voice.TEMPLATE[cite_news, url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-why-bombing-ashkelon-is-the-most-tragic-irony-1216228.html, title=Robert Fisk: Why bombing Ashkelon is the most tragic irony, last=Fisk, first=Robert, date=30 December 2008, work=[[The Independent]], accessdate=6 June 2013] As a cultural critic, academic, and writer, Said is best known for the book Orientalism (1978), an analysis of the culturally inaccurate representations that are the bases of Orientalism (a term he coined) — the Western study of Eastern cultures; how The West perceives and represents The East.Ghazoul 290ff.\"\"Edward W. Said (1935–2003) is best known as the author of the influential and widely-read Orientalism (1978)...His forceful defense of secular humanism and of the public role of the intellectual, as much as his trenchant critiques of Orientalism, and his unwavering advocacy of the Palestinian cause, made Said one of the most internationally influential cultural commentators writing out of the United States in the last quarter of the twentieth century\"\", Zamir 8031-32.\"\"Edward Said's influential Orientalism (1979) effectively created a discursive field in cultural studies, stimulating fresh critical analysis of Western academic work on the Orient. Although the book has been criticized from many angles, it is still considered to be the seminal work to the field,\"\" Gentz 41ff.\"\"In its current usage, Orient is a key term of cultural critique that derives from Edward W. Said's influential book Orientalism\"\", Gray et al. 212.}} He contended that Orientalist scholarship was, and remains, inextricably tied to the imperialist societies that produced it, which makes much of the work inherently political, servile to power, and therefore intellectually suspect. Orientalism is based upon Said’s intimate knowledge of colonial literature, such as the fiction of Joseph Conrad, and the post-structuralist theories of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, Giambattista Vico, Antonio Gramsci, and Theodor Adorno; and the literary theories of R. P. Blackmur and Raymond Williams, and other philosophers. Orientalism, and his other thematically related works, proved analytically influential in the fields of the humanities, especially in literary theory and in literary criticism.“Between Worlds”, Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays (2002) pp. 561, 565. Moreover, Orientalism proved especially influential upon the field of Middle Eastern studies, wherein it transformed the academic discourse of the field’s practitioners, of how they examine, describe, and define the cultures of the Middle East.Stephen Howe, “Dangerous mind?”, New Humanist, Vol. 123, November/December 2008. As a critic, he vigorously discussed and debated the cultural subjects comprised by Orientalism, especially as applied to and in the fields of history and area studies; nonetheless, some mainstream academics disagreed with Said’s Orientalism thesis, especially the Anglo–American Orientalist Bernard Lewis.Oleg Grabar, Edward Said, Bernard Lewis, “Orientalism: An Exchange”, New York Review of Books, Vol. 29, No. 13. 12 August 1982. Accessed 4 January 2010. As a public intellectual, Said discussed contemporary politics and culture, literature and music in books, lectures, and articles. Drawing from his family experiences, as Palestinian Christians in the Middle East, at the time of the establishment of Israel (1948), Said argued for the establishment of a Palestinian state, for equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel — including the right of return — and for increased U.S. political pressure upon Israel to recognize, grant, and respect said rights; moreover, in that vein, the public intellectual Edward Said also criticized the political and cultural politics of the Arab and Muslim régimes who acted against the interests of their peoples.Richard Bernstein, “Edward Said, Literary Critic and Advocate for Palestinian Independence, Dies at 67”, The New York Times. 26 September 2003. Accessed 5 January 2010. In 1999, with his friend Daniel Barenboim, Edward Said co-founded the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra, based in Seville, which comprises young Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians. Besides being a Renaissance Man, Said was an accomplished pianist, and a music journalist; and, with Barenboim, he co-authored the book Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society (2002), a compilation of their conversations about music.Democracy Now!, \"\"Edward Said Archive\"\", DemocracyNow.org, 2003.

Early life Edward Said was born on 1 November 1935, to Hilda Said and her husband, the businessman Wadir Said, in the Jerusalem city of the British Mandate of Palestine (1920–48).TEMPLATE[cite_news, first=Robert, last=Hughes, title=Envoy to Two Cultures, url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978727,00.html, newspaper=[[Time (magazine), Time]], date=1993-06-21, accessdate=2008-10-21] Edward's father was a Palestinian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the Allied Expeditionary Force (1917–19), commanded by General John J. Pershing, in the First World War (1914–18); Wadir Said and his family were granted U.S. citizenship due to his war-time military service. After the war, in 1919, Wadir Said moved to Cairo and established a stationery business with a cousin. Like her husband, Hilda Said was an Arab Christian, born in Nazareth, a small town in Palestine. Although his parents practiced the Jerusalemite variety of Greek Orthodox Christianity, Edward was agnostic. His only sibling, Rosemarie Said Zahlan (1937–2006), became an historian and a writer.Iskander and Rustom TEMPLATE[page].Corwell 128.TEMPLATE[Cite_book, title=Palestine, author=Joe Sacco, year=2001, publisher=Fantagraphics]Singh 19, 129.Edward Said, Defamation, Revisionist Style, CounterPunch, 1999.

At school Said described his childhood as lived \"\"between worlds\"\", the worlds of Cairo and Jerusalem, until he was twelve. In 1947, he attended the Anglican St. George’s School in Jerusalem, about which experience he said: With an unexceptionally Arab family name like \"\"Said\"\", connected to an improbably British first name (my mother much admired Prince of Wales [Edward VIII] in 1935, the year of my birth), I was an uncomfortably anomalous student all through my early years: a Palestinian going to school in Egypt, with an English first name, an American passport, and no certain identity, at all. To make matters worse, Arabic, my native language, and English, my school language, were inextricably mixed: I have never known which was my first language, and have felt fully at home in neither, although I dream in both. Every time I speak an English sentence, I find myself echoing it in Arabic, and vice versa.Edward Said, Between Worlds, London Review of Books, 7 May 1998. In the late 1940s, the latter school days of Said included attendance at the Egyptian branch of Victoria College (VC), where one classmate was Omar Sharif whom he remembered as a sadistic and physically abusive Head Boy; other classmates included King Hussein of Jordan, and Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Saudi Arabian boys whose academic careers progressed to their becoming ministers, prime ministers, and leading businessmen of and in their respective countries.TEMPLATE[cite_book, last=Said, first=Edward W., year=1999, title=Out of Place, publisher=Vintage Books, NY, page= 201] In that colonial time, the VC school educated select Arab and Levantine lads to become the Anglicized ruling-class, who, in due course, were to rule their respective countries, upon British decolonization. Victoria College was the last school Edward Said attended before being sent to the U.S.: thumb|right|300px|Edward and his sister Rosemarie (1940) The moment one became a student at VC, one was given the student handbook, a series of regulations governing every aspect of school life — the kind of uniform we were to wear, what equipment was needed for sports, the dates of school holidays, bus schedules, and so on. But the school’s first rule, emblazoned on the opening page of the handbook, read: “English is the language of the school; students caught speaking any other language will be punished.” Yet, there were no native speakers of English among the students. Whereas the masters were all British, we were a motley crew of Arabs of various kinds, Armenians, Greeks, Italians, Jews, and Turks, each of whom had a native language that the school had explicitly outlawed. Yet all, or nearly all, of us spoke Arabic — many spoke Arabic and French — and so we were able to take refuge in a common language, in defiance of what we perceived as an unjust colonial stricture.“Between Worlds”, Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays (2002) pp. 556–57. Said proved a troublesome student, and was expelled from Victoria College in 1951, and ended up in Northfield Mount Hermon School, in Massachusetts, a socially élite, college-prep boarding-school where he endured a miserable year of feeling out of place. Nonetheless, he excelled academically and achieved the rank of either first (valedectorian) or second (salutatarian) in a class of one hundred sixty students. In retrospect, Said said that having been sent away to a place so far from the Middle East was a parental decision much influenced by \"\"the prospects of deracinated people, like us, being so uncertain that it would be best to send me as far away as possible\"\". He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Princeton University (1957), and then a Master of Arts degree (1960) and a Doctor of Philosophy degree (1964), in English Literature, from Harvard University.Edward Said, Out of Place, Vintage Books, 1999: pp. 82–83.Encyclopædia Britannica Online, Edward Said, accessed 3 January 2010. Career In 1963, Said joined Columbia University as a member of the faculties of the department of English and of the department of Comparative Literature, where he taught and worked until 2003 (be became professor there in 1991); in the course of that tenure, Barack Obama was one of his pupils at Columbia College. In 1974, he was Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard College; in 1975–76 he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science, at Stanford University; in 1977, he was the Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and subsequently was the Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities; and, in 1979, he was Visiting Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University.L.A.

Said served as president of the Modern Language Association; as editor of the Arab Studies Quarterly in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; on the executive board of International PEN; in the American Academy of Arts and Letters; in the Royal Society of Literature; in the Council of Foreign Relations; and he was a member of the American Philosophical Society.Moustafa Bayoumi and Andrew Rubin, Eds., The Edward Said Reader, Vintage, 2000, pp. xv. Criticism thumb|right|250px|The 19th century novelist Joseph Conrad (1857–1924) is the subject of Edward W. Said’s first book, Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography (1966). Literary criticism The first book that Edward Said published, Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography (1966), was an expansion of the dissertation he presented to earn his doctor of philosophy degree; wherein the nature and the degree of how the autobiographic background of the writer is part of the fictional narrative, and thus contributes to the psychologic and narrative realism of the story. In Edward Said: Criticism and Society (2010), Abdirahman Hussein said that the novella Heart of Darkness (1899), by Joseph Conrad, was the book that proved “foundational to Said’s entire career and project”.Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography (1966).TEMPLATE[cite_book, last=McCarthy, first=Conor, title=The Cambridge Introduction to Edward Said, url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pagV6FegTJoC&pg=PA16, accessdate=27 February 2013, year=2010, publisher=Cambridge UP, isbn=9781139491402, pages=16–] Afterwards, Said redacted ideas gleaned from the works of the 17th-century philosopher Giambattista Vico, and other intellectuals, in the book Beginnings: Intention and Method (1974), about the theoretical bases of literary criticism.Edward Said, Power, Politics and Culture, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001: pp. 77–79. Said’s further bibliographic production featured books such as The World, the Text, and the Critic (1983), Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature: Yeats and Decolonization (1988), Culture and Imperialism (1993), Representations of the Intellectual: The 1993 Reith Lectures (1994), Humanism and Democratic Criticism (2004), and On Late Style (2006). Like his post-modern intellectual mentors, the post-structuralist philosophers Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, Said was fascinated by how the people of the Western world perceive the peoples of and the things from a different culture, and by the effects of society, politics, and power upon literature; thus is Edward W. Said a founding intellectual of post-colonial criticism. Although the critique of Orientalism is his especially important cultural contribution, it was the critical interpretations of the works of Joseph Conrad, Jane Austen, Rudyard Kipling, William Butler Yeats, and other writers, that were the influential scholarship that established his intellectual reputation.Harish Trivedi, “ ‘Arguing with the Himalayas’: Edward Said and Rudyard Kipling” Asia Pacific Reader archive.

Accessed 4 January 2010. Orientalism Said is most famous for the description and analyses of Orientalism as the source of the inaccurate cultural representations that are the foundation of Western thought towards the Middle East, of how The West perceives and represents The East. The thesis of Orientalism (1978) proposes the existence of a “subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo–Islamic peoples and their culture”, which derives from Western culture’s long tradition of false and romanticized images of Asia, in general, and the Middle East, in particular. That such perceptions, and the consequent cultural representations, have served, and continue to serve, as implicit justifications for the colonial and imperialist ambitions of the European powers and of the U.S. Likewise, Said also criticized and denounced the political and the cultural malpractices of the régimes of the ruling Arab élites who have internalized the false, romanticized representations of Arabic culture that were conceived and established by Anglo–American Orientalists:Keith Windschuttle, “Edward Said’s ‘Orientalism revisited’ ”, The New Criterion 17 January 1999.

In Orientalism, Said argued that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism meant for European self-affirmation, rather than for objective intellectual enquiry and academic study of Eastern cultures. Hence, Orientalism functioned as a method of practical, cultural discrimination applied as a means of imperialist domination — i.e. the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals.Edward Said, Orientalism, Vintage Books, New York, 1979: p. 12. As such, Orientalism has exerted much intellectual influence upon the academic fields of literary theory and cultural studies, human geography and history, and Oriental studies. Parting from the philosophic works of Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, and the works of the early critics of Orientalism — such as Abdul Latif Tibawi (“English-speaking Orientalists: A Critique of Their Approach to Islam and Arab Nationalism”, 1964),A.L. Tibawi, “English-speaking Orientalists: A Critique of Their Approach to Islam and Arab Nationalism”, Islamic Quarterly 8 (1964): pp. 25–45.

That the history of European colonial rule, and of the consequent political domination of the civilizations of the East, distorts the writing of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and culturally sympathetic Western Orientalists; thus was the term “Orientalism” rendered into a pejorative word:Ian Buruma, “Orientalism today is just another form of insult”, The Guardian, 16 June 2008. Accessed 5 January 2010. TEMPLATE[Quotation, I doubt if it is controversial, for example, to say that an Englishman in India, or Egypt, in the later nineteenth century, took an interest in those countries, which was never far from their status, in his mind, as British [[Colony, colonies]]. To say this may seem quite different from saying that all academic knowledge about India and Egypt is somehow tinged and impressed with, violated by, the gross political fact — and yet ''that is what I am saying'' in this study of Orientalism.<ref>''Orientalism'': p. 11.</ref>] thumb|right|350px|The romanticized Orient: The Reception of the Ambassadors in Damascus (1511) Moreover, Orientalism concluded that Western writing about the Orient depicts it as an irrational, weak, and feminised “Other”, an existential condition greatly contrasted with the rational, strong, and masculine West, which is a binary relation derived from the European psychological need to create a “difference” of cultural inequality, between The West and The East; that cultural difference is attributed to immutable cultural “essences” inherent to Oriental peoples and things.Orientalism: pp. 65–67. In 1978, in addition to the intellectual, cultural, and commercial successes of the book Orientalism, the thesis of cultural misrepresentation was validated by the historical resonance of the Yom Kippur war (6–25 October 1973), and of the 1973 Oil Embargo crises of reduced petroleum-production, with which the Middle East and the OPEC countries made themselves politically known to The Western World, as peoples, and not just as exotic Others.Orientalism: Afterword, pp. 329–352.

Edward Said and the Double Standards of Inside-out Colonialism” (1993), Ernest Gellner said that Said’s contentions that the West had dominated the East for more than 2,000 years were unsupportable, because the Ottoman Empire (1299–1922) had remained a great politico–military threat to Europe until the late 17th century.Ernest Gellner, \"\"The Mightier Pen?

In “Disraeli as an Orientalist: The Polemical Errors of Edward Said” (2005), Mark Proudman reported that Said said that the British Empire extended from Egypt to India in the late 19th century, when, in fact, the Ottoman Empire and the Persian Empire also were active imperial actors in that geopolitical theatre.Mark F. Proudman, \"\"Disraeli as an Orientalist: The Polemical Errors of Edward Said\"\" Journal of the Historical Society, 5 December 2005. In Empire and Information: Intelligence Gathering and Social Communication in India, 1780–1870 (1996) Christopher Alan Bayly said that, at the height of European imperialism, European power in the Orient was not absolute, and much depended upon local collaborators, who often subverted the imperial strategies of the European powers with whom they collaborated against their own peoples.C.A. Bayly Empire and Information, Delhi: Cambridge UP, 1999: pp. 25, 143, 282. In For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies (2006), Robert Irwin said that Palestine and Egypt were poor historical examples of Orientalism, because they were under European control (imperial and hegemonic) only for short periods in the late 19th century and in the early 20th century. Conversely, that Said devoted less attention to the more apt examples of the British Raj (1858–1947) in India, and to Russia’s Asian dominions — because he (Said) sought to score political points against Western misbehaviour in the Middle East.Robert Irwin For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies (London: Allen Lane, 2006: pp. 159–60, 281–82). The criticism by Orientalists such as Albert Hourani, Robert Graham Irwin, Nikki Keddie, Bernard Lewis, and Kanan Makiya, addressed what the historian Nikki Keddie said were “some unfortunate consequences” of Orientalism upon the perception and the status of their scholarship.Bernard Lewis, “The Question of Orientalism”, Islam and the West, London, 1993: pp. 99, 118.Robert Irwin, For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies, London: Allen Lane, 2006. TEMPLATE[#tag:ref, Martin Kramer said that “Fifteen years after [the] publication of ''Orientalism'', the UCLA historian Nikki Keddie (whose work Said praised in ''[[Covering Islam, Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World]]'') allowed that ''Orientalism'' was ‘important, and, in many ways, positive’ ”.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/SaidSplash.htm&date=2009-10-26+02:20:28 \"\"Said’s Splash\"\"] ''Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America'', Policy Papers 58 (Washington, D.C.: Washington Institute for Near East Policy, 2001).</ref>] In Approaches to the History of the Middle East, the historian Keddie said that, as critical theory, Said’s work on Orientalism had:TEMPLATE[Quotation, unfortunate consequences . . . I think that there has been a tendency in the Middle East [studies] field to adopt the word “Orientalism” as a generalized swear-word, essentially referring to people who take the “wrong” position on the Arab–Israeli dispute, or to people who are judged “too conservative”. It has nothing to do with whether they are good or not good in their disciplines. So, “Orientalism”, for many people, is a word that substitutes for thought, and enables people to dismiss certain scholars and their works. I think that is too bad. It may not have been what Edward Said meant, at all, but the term has become a kind of slogan.<ref>''Approaches to the History of the Middle East'', Nancy Elizabeth Gallagher, Ed., London:Ithaca Press, 1994: pp. 144–45.</ref>, group=\"\"nb\"\"] thumb|right|250px|About Orientalism, the professors Bernard Lewis (above) and Edward Said disagreed.Moreover, the Anglo–American Orientalist Bernard Lewis was a nemesis especially at odds with the thesis of Orientalism, wherein Said identified Lewis as: TEMPLATE[Quotation, . . . a perfect exemplification [of an] Establishment Orientalist [whose work] purports to be objective, liberal scholarship, but is, in reality, very close to being propaganda ''against'' his subject material.<ref>''Orientalism'': p. 316</ref> For sheer heedless anti-intellectualism, unrestrained or unencumbered by the slightest trace of critical self-consciousness, no one, in my experience, has achieved the sublime confidence of Bernard Lewis, whose almost purely political exploits require more time to mention than they are worth. In a series of articles, and one particularly weak book — ''The Muslim Discovery of Europe'' (1982) — Lewis has been busy responding to my argument, insisting that the Western quest for knowledge about other societies is unique, that it is motivated by pure curiosity, and that, in contrast, Muslims neither were able nor interested in getting knowledge about Europe, as if knowledge about Europe were the only acceptable criterion for true knowledge.<br><br>Lewis’s arguments are presented as emanating exclusively from the scholar’s apolitical impartiality, whereas, at the same time, he has become an authority drawn on for anti–Islamic, anti–Arab, Zionist, and Cold War crusades, all of them underwritten by a zealotry, covered with a veneer of urbanity, that has very little in common with the “science” and learning Lewis purports to be upholding.<ref name=\"\"Edward Said 1985, p. 96\"\">Edward Said, “Orientalism Reconsidered”, ''Cultural Critique'' magazine, No. 1, Autumn 1985, p. 96</ref>] In the event, Bernard Lewis replied to Said’s characterizations, of his (Lewis’s) works as political propaganda, and of him (Lewis) as an anti-intellectual, with essays critical of the Said, the academic man, and his works; Lewis later was joined in rejoinder of Said by the academics Maxime Rodinson, Jacques Berque, Malcolm Kerr, Aijaz Ahmad, and William Montgomery Watt who said that Orientalism (1978) is a flawed account of Western scholarship about “The Orient”.Aijaz Ahmad, In Theory: Classes, Natures, Literatures, London: Verso, 1992. In the article “Edward Said’s Shadowy Legacy” (2008), Robert Irwin said that the serious flaw in Orientalism (1978) was Said’s not having distinguished among the different types of Orientalist writers, especially because such writers possessed different cultural perspectives towards the peoples and places of the Orient — writers such as the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (who never travelled to the East); the French novelist Gustave Flaubert (who toured Egypt); the French geographer Joseph-Ernest Renan (whose work is racist in perspective); and the British Orientalist, translator, and lexicographer Edward William Lane, who was a fluent speaker of the Arabic tongue.Robert Irwin, \"\"Edward Said's shadowy legacy\"\", Times Literary Supplement, 7 May 2008. Accessed 5 January 2010. In Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said’s Orientalism (2007), Ibn Warraq said that the varied origins and cultural attitudes of European Orientalists over-rode factual and historical considerations, which Said ignored in order to construct a stereotype of Europeans befitting his thesis about the nature of Orientalism.Ibn Warraq, Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said’s Orientalism, 2007. In For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies, Robert Irwin said that Said ignored the domination of 19th-century Oriental studies by German and Hungarian Orientalists, scholars from countries without imperial colonies in the Orient.Irwin, For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies (2006): pp. 8, 150–166. In The Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Discovery of India’s Past (1988), O.P. Kejariwal said that Edward Said created a monolithic Occidentalism to oppose the monolithic Orientalism of Western discourse, by having failed to distinguish among the paradigms of Romanticism and the secular, intellectual traditions of the Age of Enlightenment. That he ignored the wide range and fundamental differences of opinion among Western scholars about the nature of Oriental peoples and things; that he failed to acknowledge that Orientalists, such as the philologist William Jones, who sought to establish cultural kinship rather than cultural difference between The East and The West; and that such scholars often made discoveries that later provided the foundations of anti-colonial nationalism.O.P. Kejariwal, The Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Discovery of India’s Past, Delhi: Oxford UP, 1988: pp. ix–xi, 221–233. Generally, such critics of Edward Said argued that he, and his academic followers, failed to critically distinguish among the varieties of Orientalism that are presented and applied in the Western mass communications media, and in Western popular culture — such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) — and Western academic studies of Oriental languages and literatures, histories and cultures.Edward Said, “Afterword” to the 1995 edition of Orientalism: p. 347.Kaizaad Navroze Kotwal, \"\"Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as Virtual Reality: The Orientalist and Colonial Legacies of Gunga Din,\"\" The Film Journal no. 12, April 2005. In the article “Who is Afraid of Edward Said?” (1999), Biswamoy Pati said that by establishing ethnicity and cultural background as the tests of authority and objectivity in studying the Orient, Edward Said drew attention to the question of his own ethnic and cultural identities as a Palestinian man and as a colonial Subaltern from the British Middle East.Biswamoy Pati, \"\"Review: Who Is Afraid of Edward Said?\"\". Social Scientist, Vol. 27. No. 9/10 (Sept.–Oct. 1999), pp. 79. In the article “Orients and Occidents: Colonial Discourse Theory and the Historiography of the British Empire”, D.A. Washbrook said that Said was disqualified from writing about the Orient because of his Anglophone rearing, schooling, and education at an élite British school in Cairo; because he had lived most of his adult life in the U.S.; and because Said was a distinguished university professor who argued that: “any and all representations . . . are embedded, first, in the language, and then in the culture, institutions, and political ambience of the representer . . . [and are] interwoven with a great many other things besides ‘The Truth’, which is, itself, a representation”.Orientalism: p. 272 That excessive cultural relativism had trapped the academic Said, and his post-colonial theorist followers, in a “web of solipsism”, which limits him and them to speak only of cultural “representations”, whilst simultaneously allowing them to deny the existence of any objective truth about the Orient.D.A. Washbrook, “Orients and Occidents: Colonial Discourse Theory and the Historiography of the British Empire”, in the Historiography entry of The Oxford History of the British Empire, volume 5, p. 607. In the event, some consequences of being a politically-militant, public intellectual occurred in 1985: the Jewish Defense League (JDL) traduced Said’s public statements about the state and nature of Arab–Israeli relations, and officially stated that Said was a Nazi, because of his anti–Zionism, which the JDL misrepresented as anti–Semitism; an arsonist set afire his office at Columbia University; and continual, attempted intimidations, personal and familial, with “innumerable death threats”.Edward Said, “Between Worlds”. London Review of Books, Vol. 20. No. 9 (May 1998), pp. 3–7. Personal criticism Justus Reid Weiner, an American lawyer, and resident scholar at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs think-tank, claimed that Said had been dishonest about his childhood biography.Christopher Hitchens, Commentary’s scurrilous attack on EdwardSaid [ ] 7 September 1999.Craig Offman, Said critic blasts back at Hitchens, Salon.com, 10 September 1999. Accessed 5 February 2010. In the Commentary magazine article “My Beautiful Old House and Other Fabrications by Edward Said” (1999), Weiner impugned Said’s intellectual honesty and personal integrity — to wit, Said lied when he said: “I was born in Jerusalem, and spent most of my formative years there; and, after 1948, when my entire family became refugees, in Egypt.”“Between Worlds: Edward Said Makes Sense of His Life”, London Review of Books, 7 May 1998, p. 3. Despite having acknowledged that Edward Said was born in Jerusalem (Palestine), Weiner reported that Edward Said’s birth certificate lists a Cairo (Egypt) residential address for the Said family; that the boy Edward did not live his formative, boyhood years in Jerusalem with his family, but in Cairo; and that the boy Edward had not been a full-time student at the St. George’s School, in Jerusalem, because the school’s register of students contained no record of his matriculation to the school. In the event, Said’s integrity was defended by three journalists and an historian, who said that the claims of Justus Weiner were false. In the Counterpunch newsletter article “Commentary ‘Scholar’ Deliberately Falsified Record in Attack on Said” (1999), Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair reported that Weiner had deliberately falsified the biographic record in order to attack Said. In evidence, the reporters presented an interview of Haig Boyadjian, who said that he had explicitly told Justus Weiner about having been a classmate of Edward Said at the St. George’s School, in Jerusalem, which fact Weiner omitted from his biographic reportage about Edward Said.Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, Commentary: 'Scholar' Deliberately Falsified Record in Attack on Said, Counterpunch 1 September 1999, accessed 10 February 2006. In The Nation magazine article “The ‘Commentary’ School of Falsification” (1999), Christopher Hitchens described Weiner’s article as a work of “extraordinary spite and mendacity”; and reported that schoolmates and instructors confirmed that Edward Said had been a student at the St. George Academy; they quoted Said, from 1992, that he had spent much of his youth in Cairo.Christopher Hitchens, The \"\"Commentary\"\" School of Falsification, The Nation, 2 September 1999.

Since its publication in the late 20th century, the book Orientalism (1978) proved to be an intellectual document central to the field of post-colonial studies, because its thesis remains historically factual, true, and accurate for the pertinent periods studied, and especially regarding the cultural representations of “Orientals” and “The Orient” presented in the mass communications media of the West.Terry Eagleton, book review of For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies, by Robert Irwin. [ ], New Statesman, 13 February 2006. Nonetheless, Said’s supporters acknowledged that concerning the German Orientalist scholarship, the scope of Orientalism is limited; yet, in the magazine article “Orientalism Reconsidered” (1985), Said said that no-one opponent provided a substantive rationale for claiming that the dearth of discussion about German Orientalism necessarily limits the scholarly value and practical application of the book’s thesis.Orientalism, pp: 18–19 Moreover, in the Afterword to the 1995 edition of Orientalism, Said presented follow-up refutations of the criticisms that Bernard Lewis registered against the first edition (1978) of the book.Orientalism: pp. 329–54 Moreover, his critics and supporters acknowledge the transformative influence of Orientalism upon scholarship in the humanities — the former say that is an intellectually limiting influence upon scholars, whilst the latter say that it is an intellectually liberating influence upon scholars.Martin Kramer.

Since then, he participated in political and diplomatic efforts for the establishment of a Palestinian state. From 1977 until 1991, Said was an independent member of the Palestinian National Council (PNC).Malise Ruthven, \"\"Edward Said: Controversial Literary Critic and Bold Advocate of the Palestinian Cause in America,\"\" The Guardian 26 September 2003; accessed 1 March 2006. In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted for the establishment of the State of Palestine at a meeting of the Palestinian National Council meeting in Algiers.

London Review of Books Vol. 15 No. 20. 21 October 1993. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to return to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre–1967 Israel; and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967. By 1995, in response to Said's political criticisms, the Palestinian Authority banned the sale of Said’s books; however, relations improved when Said publicly praised Yasir Arafat for rejecting Prime Minister Ehud Barak's minimal offers at the Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David (2000) in the U.S.Michael Wood, \"\"On Edward Said\"\", London Review of Books, 23 October 2003, accessed 5 January 2010.Edward Said, \"\"The price of Camp David\"\", Al Ahram Weekly, 23 July 2001.

Said’s books on the matters of Israel and Palestine include The Question of Palestine (1979), The Politics of Dispossession (1994), and The End of the Peace Process (2000).In 1998, for the BBC, Said made In Search of Palestine (1998), a documentary film about Palestine past and Palestine present, wherein Said returned to the country from which he had emigrated to the U.S. in 1947. Accompanied by his son Wadie, Said revisited his boyhood haunts, and confronted the Israeli injustices (social and cultural) meted out to ordinary Palestinians in the contemporary West Bank. Despite the social and cultural prestige that BBC cinema products usually enjoyed, In Search of Palestine was not broadcast by the television companies of the U.S.BFI | Film & TV Database | IN SEARCH OF PALESTINE (1998)Culture and resistance: conversations with Edward W.

Stone-throwing incident On 3 July 2000, while travelling as a tourist in the Middle East with his son, Said was photographed throwing a stone across the Blue Line Lebanese–Israeli border. In the U.S., that image elicited much conservative political criticism that Said’s action demonstrated an inherent, personal sympathy with terrorism, thus the Commentary magazine journalist Edward Alexander labelled Said as the \"\"Professor of Terror\"\".Julian Vigo, “Edward Said and the Politics of Peace: From Orientalisms to Terrorology”, A Journal of Contemporary Thought (2004): pp. 43–65. According to Said, there was not much to the incident: \"\"Mr. Said said he was having a stone-throwing contest with his son and called it a 'symbolic gesture of joy' at the end of Israel's occupation of Lebanon...It was a pebble; there was nobody there. The guardhouse was at least half a mile away.Dinitia Smith, \"\"A Stone's Throw is a Freudian Slip\"\", The New York Times, 10 March 2001. However, the As-Safir newspaper reported that a local Lebanese resident said that Said was less than ten metres (ca. 30 ft.) from the IDF soldiers manning the two-storey guardhouse when he aimed and threw the stone over the border fence; the stone struck the barbed wire atop the border fence.Sunnie Kim, \"\"Edward Said Accused of Stoning in South Lebanon\"\", Columbia Spectator, 19 July 2000. Despite the political fracas among right-wing Columbia University students and the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith International (Sons of the Covenant), the University Provost defended Said's action as an academic's freedom of expression: \"\"To my knowledge, the stone was directed at no-one; no law was broken; no indictment was made; no criminal or civil action has been taken against Professor Said\"\".TEMPLATE[cite_news, url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/19/nyregion/19COLU.html?ex=1176523200&en=ea585e33b37df5f2&ei=5070, title=Columbia Debates a Professor's 'Gesture', newspaper=The New York Times, author=Karen W.

Criticism of U.S. foreign politics In the revised edition of Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World (1997), Said criticized the Orientalist bias of the Western news media’s reportage about the Middle East and Islam, especially the tendency towards editorializing “speculations about the latest conspiracy to blow up buildings, sabotage commercial airliners, and poison water supplies.”Martin Kramer, Enough Said (review of Dangerous Knowledge, by Robert Irwin, March 2007. He criticized the military involvement of the U.S. in the Kosovo War (1998–99) as an imperialist action and described the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act as the political license that predisposed the U.S. to invade Iraq in 2003.

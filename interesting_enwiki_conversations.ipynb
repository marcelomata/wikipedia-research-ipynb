Subramaniam Swamy is a prominent Hindu figure, and the paper you noted is the opposition secular party's mouthpiece. Tamileelamnews sounds more reliable [ ]. http://www.tamileelamnews.com/aboutus/ about us section].

If, you seriously thinking they are POV pushers, why dont we take those disputed articles and analyse them ?? The problem of Tamil Net, is not that they are POV,but that they are inhuman and cant be used to represent human arguments.--Iwazaki 17:00, 26 December 2006 (UTC)  \n",

A BBC article is truly WP:NPOV, you will note that Asian Tribute is opinionated towards the SL government and is generally anti-tamil, where BBC only report the credible facts.

Trust me, I'm the last person that should directly advise another editor on how to clear up these kinds of image 'problems'; but I know we have lots of editors around here that are quite expert at providing advice on contingencies. If I have some time over the next several days, I'll poke around and perhaps try to locate a good venue in the form of a noticeboard to seek some answers.

That's too bad really, I always think that any half decent picture at the top of the article really gives the initial presentation an added boost. Trust me, I'm the last person that should directly advise another editor on how to clear up these kinds of image 'problems'; but I know we have lots of editors around here that are quite expert at providing advice on contingencies. If I have some time over the next several days, I'll poke around and perhaps try to locate a good venue in the form of a noticeboard to seek some answers. I wonder how difficult it would be to try to track down a replacement. What we need is a copy of a late 19th century book containing a plate presenting a portrait of him; the copyright would be long since gone.  cheers Deconstructhis (talk) 02:19, 16 July 2010 (UTC)   \n",

Sure enough they were replaced with \"and\" :-) I knew that would happen. The style guide probably recommends \"and\" over ampersand. The point of reintroducing ampersands is to draw attention to their demise. Some prominent typographers have talked and written about it. Using ampersands is appropriate and fitting to Typography, if not all typography-related articles, and acceptable if you ignore all the rules to make a better encyclopedia.\\n:Arbo talk 20:06, 15 October 2006 (UTC)   \n",

       "78606  :I would like to point out that Wikipedia relies on secondary sources, meaning that personal interpretations of ancient texts are considered original research.  Even if you are one of the few people that fully understand the form and language of these documents, there is no way to prove your credentials.

The church organization during the early church underwent a number of changes through the years. For example, in 1830, there were just Elders, Priests, and Teachers, with Smith being the First Elder. (And some have argued, controversially, that Elder was originally an Aaronic Priesthood office.) The chart should also reflect more prominently the office of Patriarch, which was a much more important and independent position when it was held by Hyrum Smith. Also, I have a problem with the hierarchical nature of the chart. The hierarchical relationships implied by the arrows are generally the contribution of Brigham Young, rather than Joseph Smith.

The new Materiel Articulé cars, whose design started in 1936, but were produced only in 1951, were not satisfactory either. This opened the path to the successful experiments of 1951, which validated the feasibility of the system, and the better performance on steep grade, acceleration and braking compared to the 30's cars.

The art of re-writing history seems to be the goal of more than making history because it is easier to re-write, though these days we can remember the race, who won, and who stood on the stage.  Lance Armstrong sits in his mansion with all his money and laughgs at everyone.  The truth of the matter here is not what matters, but it is the tests over the years.  Taking seven wins actually undermines the race and to give to whatever bloke stands in second only raises of the matter of whether we should strike there name too.

The US ADA will recommend stripping the Tour titles to the UCI, but as the UCI has supported Lance in this case, and it might be that he will not be stripped in the end. The US ADA has no power to strip the Tour titles itself. These factual error needs to be reversed immediately until further decisions to be made by the UCI and other material restored to its previous state.

According to that code, whichever National Anti Drugs Organisation (NADO) under the auspices of WADA uncovers breaches of the code has authority over \"results management\", ie disqualifying an athlete.  UCI cannot simply ignore or reject USADA ruling: all they could do is challenge them before the CAS.  However, they cannot do anything without seeing the evidence, and if the evidence is not heard in a review (which Armstrong prevented), they are entitled to disclose of the NADO's \"reasoned argument\".

Thus if \\sigma(n)=2n (where sigma is the number of divisors) the proper divisors are equal to n (since 2n-n=n).  Don't worry, it's easy to get confused here with the terminology, even though it's not actually difficult when you get past that. CRGreathouse (t | c) 01:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)   \n",

Your notation is non-standard and any proof you present is OR -- and much as I'd like to see a proof, this isn't the place.  Now if you put this in your userspace instead of here, it might be better-received, but unless you do that or get a paper published this just isn't the place.

       "56483  :My biggest worry is that the original chart (and clarifying it based on the Encylopedia of Mormonism and Widstoe's work) is just too CJCoLDS - I know some about other Latter Day Saint churches and they vary from the LDS Church in how they implement the 70s, elders, and aaronic priesthood, as well as in the relative importance/authority of the First Presidency and Twelve (such as the current continuation of the First Presidency sans its president continuing as the leading body in the Community of Christ). Plus the pre-1844 Church treated what we call Stake High Councils differently and there was some debate on how they related to each other and the traveling High Council. I am thinking this now:\\n# Start with a general Quorums and offices and relationship picture chart that is here - add adjustments according to sections other than 107.\\n# Have another picture that includes the administrative quorums and the full org as used in CJCoLDS, and I could do Community of Christ too I thi...   \n",

The church organization during the early church underwent a number of changes through the years. For example, in 1830, there were just Elders, Priests, and Teachers, with Smith being the First Elder. (And some have argued, controversially, that Elder was originally an Aaronic Priesthood office.) The chart should also reflect more prominently the office of Patriarch, which was a much more important and independent position when it was held by Hyrum Smith. Also, I have a problem with the hierarchical nature of the chart. The hierarchical relationships implied by the arrows are generally the contribution of Brigham Young, rather than Joseph Smith.

       "60094  \"At the same time, Charles de Gaulle sought to differentiate the French and their way of doing things, as well as create a morale booster. So the real impetus for implementing this burdensome system was political, not technical merit. \"\\nCan anyone prove this claim? - that the principal reason for use of the rubber-tire system in the Paris metro is \"political, not technical\". Also, that DeGaulle had substantial input into the decision. Doubtlessly, supporters of such rubber tire systems would point out the numerous technical advantages of rubber tire metros (faster acceleration and braking, noise reduction compared to the older metros of that era, etc.).\\nAlso, there is a potential issue of French-bashing. Calling a stereotypically \"French\" technology a  \"burdensome system\" (when it does have many merits) and claiming that it has \"not been widely adopted, except by the few cities listed below\" (when that list of cities  is actually fairly substantial and not limited to France or F...   \n",
       "60095  Since Charles De Gaulle was not in power from 1946 to 1958, the decision to start the rubber tire program did not come from him. However, given the timeframe of the conversion of lines 1 & 4, he may have pushed for this solution, but I somewhat doubt it.\\nFrom the documents I possess, the usual explainantions for the development of rubber tire system is that the 1900-1930s Sprague-Thomson cars from the Paris subway had a very hard time on the steepest grades of the network, especially on the difficult 11 line. The new Materiel Articulé cars, whose design started in 1936, but were produced only in 1951, were not satisfactory either. This opened the path to the successful experiments of 1951, which validated the feasibility of the system, and the better performance on steep grade, acceleration and braking compared to the 30's cars. The RATP did not look back on rail cars until 1966, when it appeared that converting the whole network would be too long, too expensive, and that it woul...   \n",

It is a fairly sufficient overview of the kid characters (ones who mandate an entry per Wiki standards) and is currently about 40 kb long. Once (if) the characters who have their own articles are merged into a respective list, and then those lists are edited to weed out all the excess POV, OR, and in-universe cruft details, I believe four lists (families, students, school staff, supporting) could encompass everybody. So if I follow you correctly (merging both \"residents\" and \"minor characters\" into a new List of supporting characters on South Park article), I would definitely support such a proposal. - SoSaysChappy (talk) 00:41, 3 July 2009 (UTC)   \n",

I was visualizing a radiator in vaccum. I guess a better example would be heat from a fireplace, where you feel the infrared radiation as you come close to it. But at the same time, I wanted to illustrate that the surface itself is radiating. PoorLeno 10:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)   \n",

Radiators heat by all three mechanisms.  If you're close to the radiator then you can feel the IR radiation.  You know it's radiation because you can shield yourself from it with your hand or a piece of reflective material.  If you're on the opposite side of the room then most of the heat you receive will be from convection.  If you touch the radiator then it's conduction. --Heron 19:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)   \n",

       "70963                             It is pretty funny the way this has been done with Lance Armstrong.  He actually did not admit to the doping and he has not been stripped yet, but it is nice to see Wiki as the communist in chief in charge of stripping titles and removing wins.  The art of re-writing history seems to be the goal of more than making history because it is easier to re-write, though these days we can remember the race, who won, and who stood on the stage.  Lance Armstrong sits in his mansion with all his money and laughgs at everyone.  The truth of the matter here is not what matters, but it is the tests over the years.  Taking seven wins actually undermines the race and to give to whatever bloke stands in second only raises of the matter of whether we should strike there name too.  Had the race spot been freed up, perhaps I could have trained and ridden and won all seven, give of it to me!  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 139.139.67.70 (talk) 09:06, 24 August 2012 (UTC)   \n",
       "70964  :Communist? LOL HiLo48 (talk) 11:46, 24 August 2012 (UTC)\\nActually there is serious error in the way the Armstrong case is presented.\\nCurrently it reads \"In 2012 Lance Armstrong admitted his guilt to the US Anti Doping Agency in order to stop further investigation of his alleged doping, therefore his previous wins became null and void. [187]\".\\nThis statement is false and is not support by reference 187. Armstrong has not admitted guilt and has not been stripped by the Tour. The US ADA will recommend stripping the Tour titles to the UCI, but as the UCI has supported Lance in this case, and it might be that he will not be stripped in the end. The US ADA has no power to strip the Tour titles itself. These factual error needs to be reversed immediately until further decisions to be made by the UCI and other material restored to its previous state. Otherwise, it could be seen as violating WP:LIBEL. Today's editing was premature, sloppy, and as locked as such, poorly administered. 75...   \n",

It should be clearly indicated that, as reported by the mainstream press, the US ADA has already purported to unilaterally strip Armstrong of his titles. This sets up a jurisdictional battle as to which entity has the power to strip him of his titles and so on. In other words, it is de facto not resolved yet, but according to reports the US ADA regards it (perhaps erroneously) as resolved.83.21.133.138 (talk) 07:33, 25 August 2012 (UTC)\\nYes, nicely put.  Except maybe for the \"de facto\".  Until the jurisdictional dispute is resolved, we have no business saying it's \"de jure\" resolved either, just that the USADA thinks it is. --Trovatore (talk) 08:28, 25 August 2012 (UTC)   \n",

However, they cannot do anything without seeing the evidence, and if the evidence is not heard in a review (which Armstrong prevented), they are entitled to disclose of the NADO's \"reasoned argument\".  USADA are rather unimpressed with UCI's handling of the Armstrong case over several years, but whether they have been forthcoming with their file I have not yet read.

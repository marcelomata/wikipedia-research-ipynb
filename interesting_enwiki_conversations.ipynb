       "      <td>@Yopie - Firstly, I know what WP:OWN says.  It says that I don't own the article.  Guess what, neither do you.  Decisions at Wikipedia are made by consensus.  If you don't agree with me, get other editors involved in the discussion.  Consult WP:DR.  If we cannot reach agreement, the next step is a RFC.\\nI actually agree with you that this article is about the occupation and not about the expulsions.  However, the expulsions are relevant because they are fairly closely linked to the occupation.  Were it not for the German occupation, the expulsions would have been much harder to get support for both within Czechoslovakia and in the international community.  I'm not saying that there weren't nationalist and irredentist sentiments prior to Munich.  However, up until then, it was a problem that did not demand an immediate and drastic solution.\\nThe Nazi occupation changed the minds of most of the resistance groups in the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile or, to the extent that their minds were already made up, it deepened their conviction.  The Benes decrees were promulgated by the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile which got the agreement of the Big Three at Potsdam for the expulsions.  The drive for a permanent solution to \"the German problem\" arose after the reprisals for the Heydrich assassination during the occupation.  The expulsions are the epilogue or denouement of the occupation story.  The question therefore is not about whether we discuss the expulsions but about how much to say about them and what exactly to say.\\nSecondly, I think you have a mistaken idea of what a POV fork is.  If I create a new article titled German liberation of Czechoslovakia that has a pro-Nazi view of the occupation, that would be a POV fork.  What we are debating is neither a content fork nor a POV fork and your misuse of those terms only serves to obscure the issues at hand.\\nThirdly, I don't know how much of the text restored by Lars T. was written by him and how much was text written by someone else and simply restored by him.  However, IMO, it was highly POV and aimed at indicting the Czechoslovak government and people for the expulsions which were described in highly emotive POV language that was suggestive of a war crime.  I am not in favor of such language because it is emotive rather than factual and objective.  Of course, it's tragic that innocent people died during the expulsions.  However, this is not the article to get into an extended discussion of those issues.\\nI have tried to strike a more NPOV tone in what I wrote.  If I have failed to hit the \"NPOV sweet spot\", I am open to discussing how to make the language more NPOV.  However, blanket reversions of good-faith edits is often detrimental to the objective of writing an encyclopedic article.\\nYopie, please take a step back, take a deep breath and repeat the words \"Richard is not Lars T.\"  Then re-read what I wrote in the article and what I wrote above.  Then take another deep breath and repeat the words \"I don't own the article\".  Finally, consider what specifically you don't like about what I wrote in the article and explain your concerns here.\\nI think you'll find I'm open to reason and compromise if you'll only stop reverting my edits.\\n(@Lars T. - forgive me if I am attributing to you the highly POV text that you restored after Yopie deleted it.  I don't know if you wrote it or not.  I also don't have the patience to go figure it out.  Just ignore my criticisms if they don't apply to you.)\\n--Richard S (talk) 22:46, 8 December 2010 (UTC)</td>\n",

So the real impetus for implementing this burdensome system was political, not technical merit. \"\\nCan anyone prove this claim? - that the principal reason for use of the rubber-tire system in the Paris metro is \"political, not technical\". Also, that DeGaulle had substantial input into the decision. Doubtlessly, supporters of such rubber tire systems would point out the numerous technical advantages of rubber tire metros (faster acceleration and braking, noise reduction compared to the older metros of that era, etc.).\\nAlso, there is a potential issue of French-bashing. Calling a stereotypically \"French\" technology a  \"burdensome system\" (when it does have many merits) and claiming that it has \"not been widely adopted, except by the few cities listed below\" (when that list of cities  is actually fairly substantial and not limited to France or French-speaking people) really seems grossly inaccurate. Please don't forget that are an unusually large number of other wikipedia articles have portrayed French (and Canadian) people and things in a negative light.\\nDon't believe me? Just two (of many) examples. Look at older versions of the Jacques Chirac article. Even local anti-Chirac sentiment and rather bizarre political caricatures (such as Super Menteur) by his local French liberal rivals (Chirac is by all means conservative in the American sense) seem to warrant extended treatment. Even the George W Bush article (our currently very controversial US president and a comparable figure) doesn't get quite the same ultra-detailed account of nearly every little controversy imaginable. And keep in mind that most English speakers know much more about President Bush (for example) than they know about most French people or things. Another example: Look at the Bombardier (a large Canadian conglomerate) article - a large portion is devoted to its alleged corporate misdeeds. Almost every major corporation has such controversial issues, but very few such corporations have gotten such a detailed treatment (in any mnetion at all , in some cases) on wikipedia (look at the Lockheed Martin or General Electric pages for comparable US conglomerates). Also, weak claims such as  \"Bombardier's reputation may have been tarnished\" by delays on one recent small streetcar order for Las Vegas are made in the article, while the fact that the company has successfully completed many, much larger equipment orders without technical problems for many other buyers (such as New York City) for at least 2 decades, is not mentioned in the article.\\nSo, if noone can substantiate the claims in the article about rubber tired technology in a reasonable time frame, I will edit the section (at a later time) to be more factual.\\njoseph</td>\n",

However, given the timeframe of the conversion of lines 1 &amp; 4, he may have pushed for this solution, but I somewhat doubt it.\\nFrom the documents I possess, the usual explainantions for the development of rubber tire system is that the 1900-1930s Sprague-Thomson cars from the Paris subway had a very hard time on the steepest grades of the network, especially on the difficult 11 line. The new Materiel Articulé cars, whose design started in 1936, but were produced only in 1951, were not satisfactory either. This opened the path to the successful experiments of 1951, which validated the feasibility of the system, and the better performance on steep grade, acceleration and braking compared to the 30's cars. The RATP did not look back on rail cars until 1966, when it appeared that converting the whole network would be too long, too expensive, and that it would need to replace all the older cars before the end of the conversion. Given the performance improvements provided by the 60's technology, the gap between rubber-tires and rail was much smaller. As a result, the MF67, designed at thas moment, is the most used model on the RATP network, even if it is less capable than its tired counterparts.\\n--87.88.101.119 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</td>\n",

The art of re-writing history seems to be the goal of more than making history because it is easier to re-write, though these days we can remember the race, who won, and who stood on the stage.  Lance Armstrong sits in his mansion with all his money and laughgs at everyone.  The truth of the matter here is not what matters, but it is the tests over the years.  Taking seven wins actually undermines the race and to give to whatever bloke stands in second only raises of the matter of whether we should strike there name too.

[187]\".\\nThis statement is false and is not support by reference 187. Armstrong has not admitted guilt and has not been stripped by the Tour. The US ADA will recommend stripping the Tour titles to the UCI, but as the UCI has supported Lance in this case, and it might be that he will not be stripped in the end. The US ADA has no power to strip the Tour titles itself. These factual error needs to be reversed immediately until further decisions to be made by the UCI and other material restored to its previous state. Otherwise, it could be seen as violating WP:LIBEL. Today's editing was premature, sloppy, and as locked as such, poorly administered. 75.128.7.55 (talk) 09:28, 24 August 2012 (UTC)</td>\n",

According to that code, whichever National Anti Drugs Organisation (NADO) under the auspices of WADA uncovers breaches of the code has authority over \"results management\", ie disqualifying an athlete.  UCI cannot simply ignore or reject USADA ruling: all they could do is challenge them before the CAS.  However, they cannot do anything without seeing the evidence, and if the evidence is not heard in a review (which Armstrong prevented), they are entitled to disclose of the NADO's \"reasoned argument\".

       "0    Acharya S responded on her Facebook page that due to her occupation she feels duress from stalkers knowing her \"actual name.\" Per WP:BLPNAME: When the name of a private individual has not been widely disseminated or has been intentionally concealed, such as in certain court cases or occupations, it is often preferable to omit it, especially when doing so does not result in a significant loss of context. I ask that we remove the name.

       "6    :::Were the two editors directly above invited here by email? I think this was considered in the RfC and the 4 book sources all use the name \"Dorothy M. Murdock\" and two use \"Dorothy M___ Murdock\" while referencing it to the author's own website so this seems to be rather ridiculous. WP:FULLNAME applies to leads in all biographies including \"Chelsea Elizabeth Manning[4] (born Bradley Edward Manning, December 17, 1987) so I'm not sure what the comparison proves. If anything we shouldn't really have M. when Holding and the school source the middle name.

The link to Annual Report - American School of Classical Studies at Athens on Acharya's website as part of author's expertise/credentials was there earlier, in archives and is referenced her own books. 1 cf. 2. It is clear Dorothy M. Murdock wants an exception from WP:FULLNAME, editors in RFC understood that, and equally likely the author will continue to email every admin/user on Wikipedia, nevertheless if an author cites a public record with their name in it as their expertise in their books and website and it is also cited in reliable sources, there's no reason to grant that exception. What's more of an issue is that the American School of Classical Studies at Athens shows the author was simply an \"alumna\" - i.e. a young person on an extended summer school at the time at the time and in not \"A Member\" as claimed in the author's books.

       "79   For background info, I am neither German nor Czech nor Slovak.  However, I did create Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia and Expulsion of Germans from Poland a couple years ago when I was much more active in editing the set of articles related to the expulsion.  I have not been involved in editing those articles in the last couple of years although they remain on my watchlist which is how I got here today\\n.\\nI have reverted Yopie's truncation of the edits made by Lars T.  I think the section still needs a lot of work but Yopie's edit truncated the section to the point where it omitted key facts about the expulsion.\\nWe must have a section that discusses the expulsion because it is, if you will, the epilogue to the story of the occupation.  There are those who claim that, if the occupation hadn't happened, the expulsions wouldn't have happened either.\\nI left in most of the debate about statistics although I have mixed feelings about that.  Most of the details of the debate should be presented in the article Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia.  However, we need some statistics to communicate the scale of the \"human tragedy\".  Perhaps we can work to distill the statistics text down to the essentials.\\n--Richard S (talk) 17:32, 7 December 2010 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "80   @Yopie - Firstly, I know what WP:OWN says.  It says that I don't own the article.  Guess what, neither do you.  Decisions at Wikipedia are made by consensus.  If you don't agree with me, get other editors involved in the discussion.  Consult WP:DR.  If we cannot reach agreement, the next step is a RFC.\\nI actually agree with you that this article is about the occupation and not about the expulsions.  However, the expulsions are relevant because they are fairly closely linked to the occupation.  Were it not for the German occupation, the expulsions would have been much harder to get support for both within Czechoslovakia and in the international community.  I'm not saying that there weren't nationalist and irredentist sentiments prior to Munich.  However, up until then, it was a problem that did not demand an immediate and drastic solution.\\nThe Nazi occupation changed the minds of most of the resistance groups in the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile or, to the extent that their minds were already made up, it deepened their conviction.  The Benes decrees were promulgated by the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile which got the agreement of the Big Three at Potsdam for the expulsions.  The drive for a permanent solution to \"the German problem\" arose after the reprisals for the Heydrich assassination during the occupation.  The expulsions are the epilogue or denouement of the occupation story.  The question therefore is not about whether we discuss the expulsions but about how much to say about them and what exactly to say.\\nSecondly, I think you have a mistaken idea of what a POV fork is.  If I create a new article titled German liberation of Czechoslovakia that has a pro-Nazi view of the occupation, that would be a POV fork.  What we are debating is neither a content fork nor a POV fork and your misuse of those terms only serves to obscure the issues at hand.\\nThirdly, I don't know how much of the text restored by Lars T. was written by him and how much was text written by someone else and simply restored by him.  However, IMO, it was highly POV and aimed at indicting the Czechoslovak government and people for the expulsions which were described in highly emotive POV language that was suggestive of a war crime.  I am not in favor of such language because it is emotive rather than factual and objective.  Of course, it's tragic that innocent people died during the expulsions.  However, this is not the article to get into an extended discussion of those issues.\\nI have tried to strike a more NPOV tone in what I wrote.  If I have failed to hit the \"NPOV sweet spot\", I am open to discussing how to make the language more NPOV.  However, blanket reversions of good-faith edits is often detrimental to the objective of writing an encyclopedic article.\\nYopie, please take a step back, take a deep breath and repeat the words \"Richard is not Lars T.\"  Then re-read what I wrote in the article and what I wrote above.  Then take another deep breath and repeat the words \"I don't own the article\".  Finally, consider what specifically you don't like about what I wrote in the article and explain your concerns here.\\nI think you'll find I'm open to reason and compromise if you'll only stop reverting my edits.\\n(@Lars T. - forgive me if I am attributing to you the highly POV text that you restored after Yopie deleted it.  I don't know if you wrote it or not.  I also don't have the patience to go figure it out.  Just ignore my criticisms if they don't apply to you.)\\n--Richard S (talk) 22:46, 8 December 2010 (UTC)   \n",
       "81   \"At the same time, Charles de Gaulle sought to differentiate the French and their way of doing things, as well as create a morale booster. So the real impetus for implementing this burdensome system was political, not technical merit. \"\\nCan anyone prove this claim? - that the principal reason for use of the rubber-tire system in the Paris metro is \"political, not technical\". Also, that DeGaulle had substantial input into the decision. Doubtlessly, supporters of such rubber tire systems would point out the numerous technical advantages of rubber tire metros (faster acceleration and braking, noise reduction compared to the older metros of that era, etc.).\\nAlso, there is a potential issue of French-bashing. Calling a stereotypically \"French\" technology a  \"burdensome system\" (when it does have many merits) and claiming that it has \"not been widely adopted, except by the few cities listed below\" (when that list of cities  is actually fairly substantial and not limited to France or French-speaking people) really seems grossly inaccurate. Please don't forget that are an unusually large number of other wikipedia articles have portrayed French (and Canadian) people and things in a negative light.\\nDon't believe me? Just two (of many) examples. Look at older versions of the Jacques Chirac article. Even local anti-Chirac sentiment and rather bizarre political caricatures (such as Super Menteur) by his local French liberal rivals (Chirac is by all means conservative in the American sense) seem to warrant extended treatment. Even the George W Bush article (our currently very controversial US president and a comparable figure) doesn't get quite the same ultra-detailed account of nearly every little controversy imaginable. And keep in mind that most English speakers know much more about President Bush (for example) than they know about most French people or things. Another example: Look at the Bombardier (a large Canadian conglomerate) article - a large portion is devoted to its alleged corporate misdeeds. Almost every major corporation has such controversial issues, but very few such corporations have gotten such a detailed treatment (in any mnetion at all , in some cases) on wikipedia (look at the Lockheed Martin or General Electric pages for comparable US conglomerates). Also, weak claims such as  \"Bombardier's reputation may have been tarnished\" by delays on one recent small streetcar order for Las Vegas are made in the article, while the fact that the company has successfully completed many, much larger equipment orders without technical problems for many other buyers (such as New York City) for at least 2 decades, is not mentioned in the article.\\nSo, if noone can substantiate the claims in the article about rubber tired technology in a reasonable time frame, I will edit the section (at a later time) to be more factual.\\njoseph                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "82   Since Charles De Gaulle was not in power from 1946 to 1958, the decision to start the rubber tire program did not come from him. However, given the timeframe of the conversion of lines 1 & 4, he may have pushed for this solution, but I somewhat doubt it.\\nFrom the documents I possess, the usual explainantions for the development of rubber tire system is that the 1900-1930s Sprague-Thomson cars from the Paris subway had a very hard time on the steepest grades of the network, especially on the difficult 11 line. The new Materiel Articulé cars, whose design started in 1936, but were produced only in 1951, were not satisfactory either. This opened the path to the successful experiments of 1951, which validated the feasibility of the system, and the better performance on steep grade, acceleration and braking compared to the 30's cars. The RATP did not look back on rail cars until 1966, when it appeared that converting the whole network would be too long, too expensive, and that it would need to replace all the older cars before the end of the conversion. Given the performance improvements provided by the 60's technology, the gap between rubber-tires and rail was much smaller. As a result, the MF67, designed at thas moment, is the most used model on the RATP network, even if it is less capable than its tired counterparts.\\n--87.88.101.119 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "85   This is a technical issue, not a political one.\\nConversions have stopped because they were expensive, and as time passed, steel had bettered its performance, although not as good as rubber (especially in short curves vibrations).\\nOf course, rubber better performance is due to larger surface contacts, and so the frictions are worse.\\nGonioul 01:28, 14 November 2006 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "88   Take a look at List of students at South Park Elementary, the one SP-related \"list\" article that has received some editorial attention lately. It is a fairly sufficient overview of the kid characters (ones who mandate an entry per Wiki standards) and is currently about 40 kb long. Once (if) the characters who have their own articles are merged into a respective list, and then those lists are edited to weed out all the excess POV, OR, and in-universe cruft details, I believe four lists (families, students, school staff, supporting) could encompass everybody. So if I follow you correctly (merging both \"residents\" and \"minor characters\" into a new List of supporting characters on South Park article), I would definitely support such a proposal. - SoSaysChappy (talk) 00:41, 3 July 2009 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "91   Yes, all of these characters have been seen more than once, so if they must be kept, simply group the most minor ones of all in one paragraph as \"other minor recurring characters\" (or something to that extent) rather than giving too much of a detailed crufty overview/section to each of them. -SoSaysChappy (talk) 17:44, 2 July 2009 (UTC)\\nSupport, because Wikipedia is not a collection of information. However, you are suggesting to remove 14 out of 21 characters, which is 2/3 of the list. I would therefore suggest to move this list into List of supporting characters on South Park (\"supporting\" instead of \"minor\") and merge the list of Townsfolk after the proposed characters (Satan, Saddam, etc.) are merged and the 14 you suggest are removed to avoid having lots of short lists (less than 25 KB).

Again, refrain from correcting as per old version - it was full of factual errors.\\n--PoorLeno 22:43, 7 April 2006 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "95   :Hm, perhaps it was a bad example. I was visualizing a radiator in vaccum.

       "98   Try harder.  Radiators heat by all three mechanisms.  If you're close to the radiator then you can feel the IR radiation.  You know it's radiation because you can shield yourself from it with your hand or a piece of reflective material.  If you're on the opposite side of the room then most of the heat you receive will be from convection.  If you touch the radiator then it's conduction. --Heron 19:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "102  It is pretty funny the way this has been done with Lance Armstrong.  He actually did not admit to the doping and he has not been stripped yet, but it is nice to see Wiki as the communist in chief in charge of stripping titles and removing wins.  The art of re-writing history seems to be the goal of more than making history because it is easier to re-write, though these days we can remember the race, who won, and who stood on the stage.  Lance Armstrong sits in his mansion with all his money and laughgs at everyone.  The truth of the matter here is not what matters, but it is the tests over the years.  Taking seven wins actually undermines the race and to give to whatever bloke stands in second only raises of the matter of whether we should strike there name too.  Had the race spot been freed up, perhaps I could have trained and ridden and won all seven, give of it to me!  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 139.139.67.70 (talk) 09:06, 24 August 2012 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "103  :Communist? LOL HiLo48 (talk) 11:46, 24 August 2012 (UTC)\\nActually there is serious error in the way the Armstrong case is presented.\\nCurrently it reads \"In 2012 Lance Armstrong admitted his guilt to the US Anti Doping Agency in order to stop further investigation of his alleged doping, therefore his previous wins became null and void. [187]\".\\nThis statement is false and is not support by reference 187. Armstrong has not admitted guilt and has not been stripped by the Tour. The US ADA will recommend stripping the Tour titles to the UCI, but as the UCI has supported Lance in this case, and it might be that he will not be stripped in the end. The US ADA has no power to strip the Tour titles itself. These factual error needs to be reversed immediately until further decisions to be made by the UCI and other material restored to its previous state. Otherwise, it could be seen as violating WP:LIBEL. Today's editing was premature, sloppy, and as locked as such, poorly administered. 75.128.7.55 (talk) 09:28, 24 August 2012 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "104  Right now the information about Armstrong in the entry is still misleading. It should be clearly indicated that, as reported by the mainstream press, the US ADA has already purported to unilaterally strip Armstrong of his titles. This sets up a jurisdictional battle as to which entity has the power to strip him of his titles and so on. In other words, it is de facto not resolved yet, but according to reports the US ADA regards it (perhaps erroneously) as resolved.83.21.133.138 (talk) 07:33, 25 August 2012 (UTC)\\nYes, nicely put.  Except maybe for the \"de facto\".  Until the jurisdictional dispute is resolved, we have no business saying it's \"de jure\" resolved either, just that the USADA thinks it is. --Trovatore (talk) 08:28, 25 August 2012 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "106  :The USADA, which claims the authority to do so, considers all Armstrong's results since 1 August 1998 null: the UCI contests the jurisdiction of UASDA in the matter, as the ban does not arise from testing, and it has requested the evidence for the ban.

According to that code, whichever National Anti Drugs Organisation (NADO) under the auspices of WADA uncovers breaches of the code has authority over \"results management\", ie disqualifying an athlete.  UCI cannot simply ignore or reject USADA ruling: all they could do is challenge them before the CAS.  However, they cannot do anything without seeing the evidence, and if the evidence is not heard in a review (which Armstrong prevented), they are entitled to disclose of the NADO's \"reasoned argument\".

Trust me, I'm the last person that should directly advise another editor on how to clear up these kinds of image 'problems'; but I know we have lots of editors around here that are quite expert at providing advice on contingencies. If I have some time over the next several days, I'll poke around and perhaps try to locate a good venue in the form of a noticeboard to seek some answers.

Even if you are one of the few people that fully understand the form and language of these documents, there is no way to prove your credentials.  Therefore, please cite sources where real scholars make the interpretations, and not your personal opinion or a blog piece.  William George Aston has translated the Nihon Shoki into English, if that helps.  Disputes between scholarly, published interpretations should be fully represented (with cites) on either side.  If you approach Wikipedia with this in mind, you'll see that there is really no reason to bicker this way, as the sole aim becomes to archive relevant information regardless of personal opinion.\\n:In that vein, the Cambridge's History of Japan has several references based on the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki about Ame-no-Hiboko, his Korean (Silla) ancestry, and how he traveled to Japan bearing gifts.  I can provide inline citations for this if needed, but this is generally not in contention.  I do not have references regarding his relationship with Empress Jingū.  If you can provide a secondary source for this like I did above, please do.\\n:Finally, the Nihon Shoki is not a comparatively \"nationalistic\" or unreliable source.  I'm afraid this notion has been overblown by people seeking to unfairly undermine the document.  It does display internal bias, self-aggrandizement, and there is a political purpose behind its composition.  This however, is hardly uncommon amongst ancient texts in Asia or around the world.  Furthermore, the inaccuracies are pointed out in virtually every publication within the last few decades; I have never read a book that bought the texts literally without at least a followup caveat sentence, if not a full refutation.  Again, one must simply portray both sides of the argument instead of disputing over which one side is favourable.  I hope this helps both parties involved here to achieve neutrality.

I am new to wikiland so bear with me and try not to use the royal \"we\" with me--it's a little high handed; there is more neutral way to say that.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by CJ3370 (talk • contribs) 22:38, 14 July 2010 (UTC)\\nExcellent job! Dunlop has been deserving of a much more informative presentation of both his interesting life and its impact on the development of southwestern Ontario in proper article form for years now.

       "6       Comment  Sorry that you took offense, but it wasn't a \"royal\" we; it's meaning was that we, as Wikipedia editors or the Wikipedia community, don't do it that way.  Now to add being patronising to my crimes: you've done an excellent job with the merge.  Have you really only been on Wikipedia for a month?  Don't worry about getting things wrong every so often.  We (and I mean we) are all still learning, and there's not much you can do that can't be undone if a mistake is made.  Enjoy your time on here, and if this article is anything to go by, may you be here a long time!

       "8       I've noticed that the current image that's accompanying the article is marked for deletion on 21 July because of licensing issues. That's too bad really, I always think that any half decent picture at the top of the article really gives the initial presentation an added boost. Trust me, I'm the last person that should directly advise another editor on how to clear up these kinds of image 'problems'; but I know we have lots of editors around here that are quite expert at providing advice on contingencies. If I have some time over the next several days, I'll poke around and perhaps try to locate a good venue in the form of a noticeboard to seek some answers. I wonder how difficult it would be to try to track down a replacement.

It sits on my wall at home and is really rather large, in fact I have no connection with the name Dunlop and it seems rather odd to own the painting when there is probably someone out there that would want it far more than me so if anyone reading this is interested then its up for sale, It is framed in its original gilded picture frame and has the name on a plaque at the bottom of the frame, and it is the exact original to the black and white photo shown on the page for Tiger Dunlop on this website , my email is giles625@tiscali.co.uk , Many Thanks  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 88.107.125.229 (talk) 14:37, 7 January 2011 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "18      ::Thanks for finding that convention, it's a lot more helpful than the MoS. Are we sure of how the band capitalizes? I only ask because I haven't seen anything from them that names the album in standard-formatted text - the album cover mixes fonts, and it's unclear whether it's in all caps or not. the Guardian style guide from the discussion you linked seems unambiguous in its support of capitalization of verbs. The Times says \"As a rule of , use l/c for prepositions, conjunctions, definite and indefinite articles\", which supports by omission capitalization. Given the WikiProject convention and the sources we have here, it looks like the burden of argument is on the \"don't capitalise\" side. the skomorokh 01:46, 13 November 2008 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Sure enough they were replaced with \"and\" :-) I knew that would happen. The style guide probably recommends \"and\" over ampersand. The point of reintroducing ampersands is to draw attention to their demise. Some prominent typographers have talked and written about it. Using ampersands is appropriate and fitting to Typography, if not all typography-related articles, and acceptable if you ignore all the rules to make a better encyclopedia.\\n:Arbo talk 20:06, 15 October 2006 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "26      I have found it useful to use the ampersand to aviod confusion in lists. I.e. \"The public houses I frequent include The Bell, The Pig & The Whistle and The Horses\". Without the ampersand \"The Pig and The Whistle\" could look like two places or \"The Whistle and The Horses\" could look like one place.

All of what we know about Baekje comes from Korean works written 500 years after its destruction Samguk Sagi, and another Korean work written 600 years after its destruction Samguk Yusa, and the Gwanggaeto Stele!  Of course we need the Stele.  Especially so since Koreans do not give any credence to the only two historical works written during the Three Kingdoms period, because they were written in Japan...

Although there are scholars who controvert the Conspiracy theories, stating only the information on Korean study on the stele is not fair.--Michael Friedrich (talk) 10:18, 1 October 2008 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "106386  @Blue Ghost, please provide citations, so that we can verify the edits in question. @Cherry, I'd doubt that there was any advanced notion of Japanese nationalism back in 720AD. A biased view may be in all historical documents from any side or country, but I'd doubt nationalism is the problem, given that most of Japan's nationalism formulated after the Meiji Restoration. I don't see how nationalism links with this. -- 李博杰  | —Talk contribs email 23:42, 15 July 2009 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "106387  :I would like to point out that Wikipedia relies on secondary sources, meaning that personal interpretations of ancient texts are considered original research.  Even if you are one of the few people that fully understand the form and language of these documents, there is no way to prove your credentials.  Therefore, please cite sources where real scholars make the interpretations, and not your personal opinion or a blog piece.  William George Aston has translated the Nihon Shoki into English, if that helps.  Disputes between scholarly, published interpretations should be fully represented (with cites) on either side.  If you approach Wikipedia with this in mind, you'll see that there is really no reason to bicker this way, as the sole aim becomes to archive relevant information regardless of personal opinion.\\n:In that vein, the Cambridge's History of Japan has several references based on the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki about Ame-no-Hiboko, his Korean (Silla) ancestry, and how he traveled to Japan bearing gifts.  I can provide inline citations for this if needed, but this is generally not in contention.  I do not have references regarding his relationship with Empress Jingū.  If you can provide a secondary source for this like I did above, please do.\\n:Finally, the Nihon Shoki is not a comparatively \"nationalistic\" or unreliable source.  I'm afraid this notion has been overblown by people seeking to unfairly undermine the document.  It does display internal bias, self-aggrandizement, and there is a political purpose behind its composition.  This however, is hardly uncommon amongst ancient texts in Asia or around the world.  Furthermore, the inaccuracies are pointed out in virtually every publication within the last few decades; I have never read a book that bought the texts literally without at least a followup caveat sentence, if not a full refutation.  Again, one must simply portray both sides of the argument instead of disputing over which one side is favourable.  I hope this helps both parties involved here to achieve neutrality.

       "106389  First of all, it's Nihon Shoki not Nohon, secondly even Nihon Shoki is based from collection of clan chronicles and native myths and it was heavily edited, the original draft copy is no longer existed anymore. So it's not historically accurate considering many dating is incorrect and logically does not provide citing. Therefore we can only make final conclusion with archaeological evidence to prove that some accounts from Nihon Shoki. Btw, This Empress Jingu story is based from c. AD 169 - 269 period, at this time, all major Kingdoms of Korea were well established and much older than so called Jingu. And this is the period of Gaya Kingdom of Korea was busy fighting with their neighbors like Shilla. Even from Japanese POV, the horse rider invasion theory of early Japan pointing to Korean peninsula. identical copies of Gaya, Shilla and Baekje artifacts are discovered from early Japan's tombs. Not too mention, all of Japan's kofuns were made accordingly very Korean style. Also, considering Japanese also have distorted many historical data, I can only assumed that Jingu theory goes back to chaotic periods of ancient Korea, not Japan. Mind you this Jingu origin is still being debated among Japanese/Korean and East Asian scholars because of inaccuracy of Japanese claims.--Korsentry 01:54, 20 July 2009 (UTC)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by KoreanSentry (talk • contribs)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "106392  It is illogical and unscientific to criticize Kojiki and Nihon shoki when there are ZERO history books from the same period from Korea.  Korean nationalists continue to boast about the advanced state of their three kingdoms compared to Yamato Japan, but the oldest Korean history books are from Goryeo period.  Silla surrendered peacefully to Goryeo, so don't try to state that \"all our history books burned during our many wars..\"  Japan had as much Civil Wars in its history.  Furthermore, Samguk Yusa and Samguk Sagi mention IMNA over a hundred times.  And all of so called advanced iron plate armor and swords are entirely found in Gaya region.  Not one piece of Plate armor is ever found in Goguryeo, Silla, or Baekje regions.  These facts lend strong credence to Gaya having been the launch point and remnant of the continental horse riders who crossed over to Japan and subdued the Jomon people.Krusader6 (talk) 07:06, 22 April 2014 (UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

I just think it makes it look confusing. It is much more easier to read when it is the other way like I said before. No rush, just reverse it when you have time. This failed FA again because of some unfair racial issues above all, so I've taken this to Good Article nomination and we'll go from there. I'm just trying to find ways to fix/improve this article further. Above that, trying to replace Javno.com as a reference even though they are fairly reliable in Europe and here in Australia.

If I have some time over the next several days, I'll poke around and perhaps try to locate a good venue in the form of a noticeboard to seek some answers.

That's too bad really, I always think that any half decent picture at the top of the article really gives the initial presentation an added boost. Trust me, I'm the last person that should directly advise another editor on how to clear up these kinds of image 'problems'; but I know we have lots of editors around here that are quite expert at providing advice on contingencies. If I have some time over the next several days, I'll poke around and perhaps try to locate a good venue in the form of a noticeboard to seek some answers. I wonder how difficult it would be to try to track down a replacement. What we need is a copy of a late 19th century book containing a plate presenting a portrait of him; the copyright would be long since gone.  cheers Deconstructhis (talk) 02:19, 16 July 2010 (UTC)   \n",

Sure enough they were replaced with \"and\" :-) I knew that would happen. The style guide probably recommends \"and\" over ampersand. The point of reintroducing ampersands is to draw attention to their demise. Some prominent typographers have talked and written about it. Using ampersands is appropriate and fitting to Typography, if not all typography-related articles, and acceptable if you ignore all the rules to make a better encyclopedia.\\n:Arbo talk 20:06, 15 October 2006 (UTC)   \n",

       "78606  :I would like to point out that Wikipedia relies on secondary sources, meaning that personal interpretations of ancient texts are considered original research.  Even if you are one of the few people that fully understand the form and language of these documents, there is no way to prove your credentials.

The new Materiel Articulé cars, whose design started in 1936, but were produced only in 1951, were not satisfactory either. This opened the path to the successful experiments of 1951, which validated the feasibility of the system, and the better performance on steep grade, acceleration and braking compared to the 30's cars.

It is a fairly sufficient overview of the kid characters (ones who mandate an entry per Wiki standards) and is currently about 40 kb long. Once (if) the characters who have their own articles are merged into a respective list, and then those lists are edited to weed out all the excess POV, OR, and in-universe cruft details, I believe four lists (families, students, school staff, supporting) could encompass everybody. So if I follow you correctly (merging both \"residents\" and \"minor characters\" into a new List of supporting characters on South Park article), I would definitely support such a proposal. - SoSaysChappy (talk) 00:41, 3 July 2009 (UTC)</td>\n",

The art of re-writing history seems to be the goal of more than making history because it is easier to re-write, though these days we can remember the race, who won, and who stood on the stage.  Lance Armstrong sits in his mansion with all his money and laughgs at everyone.  The truth of the matter here is not what matters, but it is the tests over the years.  Taking seven wins actually undermines the race and to give to whatever bloke stands in second only raises of the matter of whether we should strike there name too.

The US ADA will recommend stripping the Tour titles to the UCI, but as the UCI has supported Lance in this case, and it might be that he will not be stripped in the end. The US ADA has no power to strip the Tour titles itself. These factual error needs to be reversed immediately until further decisions to be made by the UCI and other material restored to its previous state.

       "55843  For background info, I am neither German nor Czech nor Slovak.  However, I did create Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia and Expulsion of Germans from Poland a couple years ago when I was much more active in editing the set of articles related to the expulsion.  I have not been involved in editing those articles in the last couple of years although they remain on my watchlist which is how I got here today\\n.\\nI have reverted Yopie's truncation of the edits made by Lars T.  I think the section still needs a lot of work but Yopie's edit truncated the section to the point where it omitted key facts about the expulsion.\\nWe must have a section that discusses the expulsion because it is, if you will, the epilogue to the story of the occupation.  There are those who claim that, if the occupation hadn't happened, the expulsions wouldn't have happened either.\\nI left in most of the debate about statistics although I have mixed feelings about that.

       "55844  @Yopie - Firstly, I know what WP:OWN says.  It says that I don't own the article.  Guess what, neither do you.  Decisions at Wikipedia are made by consensus.  If you don't agree with me, get other editors involved in the discussion.  Consult WP:DR.  If we cannot reach agreement, the next step is a RFC.\\nI actually agree with you that this article is about the occupation and not about the expulsions.  However, the expulsions are relevant because they are fairly closely linked to the occupation.  Were it not for the German occupation, the expulsions would have been much harder to get support for both within Czechoslovakia and in the international community.  I'm not saying that there weren't nationalist and irredentist sentiments prior to Munich.  However, up until then, it was a problem that did not demand an immediate and drastic solution.\\nThe Nazi occupation changed the minds of most of the resistance groups in the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile or, to the extent that their...   \n",
       "60094  \"At the same time, Charles de Gaulle sought to differentiate the French and their way of doing things, as well as create a morale booster. So the real impetus for implementing this burdensome system was political, not technical merit. \"\\nCan anyone prove this claim? - that the principal reason for use of the rubber-tire system in the Paris metro is \"political, not technical\". Also, that DeGaulle had substantial input into the decision. Doubtlessly, supporters of such rubber tire systems would point out the numerous technical advantages of rubber tire metros (faster acceleration and braking, noise reduction compared to the older metros of that era, etc.).\\nAlso, there is a potential issue of French-bashing.

       "60095  Since Charles De Gaulle was not in power from 1946 to 1958, the decision to start the rubber tire program did not come from him. However, given the timeframe of the conversion of lines 1 & 4, he may have pushed for this solution, but I somewhat doubt it.\\nFrom the documents I possess, the usual explainantions for the development of rubber tire system is that the 1900-1930s Sprague-Thomson cars from the Paris subway had a very hard time on the steepest grades of the network, especially on the difficult 11 line. The new Materiel Articulé cars, whose design started in 1936, but were produced only in 1951, were not satisfactory either. This opened the path to the successful experiments of 1951, which validated the feasibility of the system, and the better performance on steep grade, acceleration and braking compared to the 30's cars. The RATP did not look back on rail cars until 1966, when it appeared that converting the whole network would be too long, too expensive, and that it woul...   \n",

It is a fairly sufficient overview of the kid characters (ones who mandate an entry per Wiki standards) and is currently about 40 kb long. Once (if) the characters who have their own articles are merged into a respective list, and then those lists are edited to weed out all the excess POV, OR, and in-universe cruft details, I believe four lists (families, students, school staff, supporting) could encompass everybody. So if I follow you correctly (merging both \"residents\" and \"minor characters\" into a new List of supporting characters on South Park article), I would definitely support such a proposal. - SoSaysChappy (talk) 00:41, 3 July 2009 (UTC)   \n",

However, you are suggesting to remove 14 out of 21 characters, which is 2/3 of the list. I would therefore suggest to move this list into List of supporting characters on South Park (\"supporting\" instead of \"minor\") and merge the list of Townsfolk after the proposed characters (Satan, Saddam, etc.) are merged and the 14 you suggest are removed to avoid having lots of short lists (less than 25 KB).

Radiators heat by all three mechanisms.  If you're close to the radiator then you can feel the IR radiation.  You know it's radiation because you can shield yourself from it with your hand or a piece of reflective material.  If you're on the opposite side of the room then most of the heat you receive will be from convection.  If you touch the radiator then it's conduction. --Heron 19:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)   \n",

       "70963                             It is pretty funny the way this has been done with Lance Armstrong.  He actually did not admit to the doping and he has not been stripped yet, but it is nice to see Wiki as the communist in chief in charge of stripping titles and removing wins.  The art of re-writing history seems to be the goal of more than making history because it is easier to re-write, though these days we can remember the race, who won, and who stood on the stage.  Lance Armstrong sits in his mansion with all his money and laughgs at everyone.  The truth of the matter here is not what matters, but it is the tests over the years.  Taking seven wins actually undermines the race and to give to whatever bloke stands in second only raises of the matter of whether we should strike there name too.  Had the race spot been freed up, perhaps I could have trained and ridden and won all seven, give of it to me!  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 139.139.67.70 (talk) 09:06, 24 August 2012 (UTC)   \n",
       "70964  :Communist? LOL HiLo48 (talk) 11:46, 24 August 2012 (UTC)\\nActually there is serious error in the way the Armstrong case is presented.\\nCurrently it reads \"In 2012 Lance Armstrong admitted his guilt to the US Anti Doping Agency in order to stop further investigation of his alleged doping, therefore his previous wins became null and void. [187]\".\\nThis statement is false and is not support by reference 187. Armstrong has not admitted guilt and has not been stripped by the Tour. The US ADA will recommend stripping the Tour titles to the UCI, but as the UCI has supported Lance in this case, and it might be that he will not be stripped in the end. The US ADA has no power to strip the Tour titles itself. These factual error needs to be reversed immediately until further decisions to be made by the UCI and other material restored to its previous state. Otherwise, it could be seen as violating WP:LIBEL. Today's editing was premature, sloppy, and as locked as such, poorly administered. 75...   \n",

It should be clearly indicated that, as reported by the mainstream press, the US ADA has already purported to unilaterally strip Armstrong of his titles. This sets up a jurisdictional battle as to which entity has the power to strip him of his titles and so on. In other words, it is de facto not resolved yet, but according to reports the US ADA regards it (perhaps erroneously) as resolved.83.21.133.138 (talk) 07:33, 25 August 2012 (UTC)\\nYes, nicely put.  Except maybe for the \"de facto\".  Until the jurisdictional dispute is resolved, we have no business saying it's \"de jure\" resolved either, just that the USADA thinks it is. --Trovatore (talk) 08:28, 25 August 2012 (UTC)   \n",

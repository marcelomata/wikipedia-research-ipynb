Hence it can be waived. Göring also didn't (and it wasn't him alone) arrest all SPDers but only some of them. All Communists however were arrested. A trick devised by the SPD to render parliament unable to vote was foiled by changing the procedure, so the remaining SPDers attened after all. It is correct to say that the the Centre Party's votes (and the BVP's) were necessary for the act to pass, in addition to those of Nazis, DNVP, both Liberal parties, and the smaller groupings. However, there is no foundation for including the Vatican in this. The Centre was not the Pope's puppet. (smile back) 16:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</td>\n",

The other fact was that there was yet no immunity for parliament representatives. So, Hermann Göring assisted the passing of the enabling act by suddenly imprisoning almost all representatives of the Social Democratic Party (for whatever reasons) shortly before the Enabling Act was brought in. As two thirds of the representatives attending were necessary, the Act could then be passed. I do not have a source for this, this belongs to common knowledge.

It would go be wasted. I have heard from sources that Roche is ramping up the microbial shikimate synthesis that they have licenced and will be able to produce more tamiflu. Even so, the synthesis *starting* from shikimate involves several low-yielding and dangerous steps, including a few ones with highly explosive intermediates. wouldn't call any of the steps \"low yielding\", but it's true, they aren't terrific.

This isn't really true since after WW2 only the Yugoslavia national team (which included Croatian players right from the beginning) was active. There was just a single game played in the period 1945-1990 under Croatian name, and it was just a one-off exhibition game, much like the occasional Catalonia or Basque \"national team\" games played today. There was absolutely no Croatian national team to speak of really so the sole 1956 friendly cannot be considered a continuation of the national team (there was no Croatian FA, no official manager, home kit or anything else). Furthermore, at least 5 out of 17 players at the 1956 Olympics were Croatian, so I'm not sure if that could be called \"a minor inclusion\", and Zlatko Papec (of Hajduk Split) even scored three goals for Yugoslavia.

However it should also be made clear that real text in actual use on computers usually contains so much ASCII (number, spaces, newlines, XML markup, quoted English, etc) that they are *still* shorter in UTF-8 than UTF-16. In addition it should be pointed out that most characters are entire words equivalent to 3-7 characters in English and thus they already have a huge compression advantage. Some alphabetic languages from India do have a 3-byte UTF-8 encoding of all their letters. Since their words consist of multiple characters they can end up bigger in UTF-8 than UTF-16, and there have been complaints about this. Any comment about length should mention these languages where it actually is a problem.Spitzak (talk) 21:13, 13 December 2011 (UTC)</td>\n",

Hence it can be waived. Göring also didn't (and it wasn't him alone) arrest all SPDers but only some of them. All Communists however were arrested. A trick devised by the SPD to render parliament unable to vote was foiled by changing the procedure, so the remaining SPDers attened after all. It is correct to say that the the Centre Party's votes (and the BVP's) were necessary for the act to pass, in addition to those of Nazis, DNVP, both Liberal parties, and the smaller groupings. However, there is no foundation for including the Vatican in this. The Centre was not the Pope's puppet. (smile back) 16:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)   \n",
       "2142   The Enabling Act could not have been passed with the votes of the Deutschnationale Partei, the Nazis and the Center Party alone. Decisive were two more circumstances: Herman Göring was Secretary of State of Prussia, thus he was commander in chief for the police. The other fact was that there was yet no immunity for parliament representatives. So, Hermann Göring assisted the passing of the enabling act by suddenly imprisoning almost all representatives of the Social Democratic Party (for whatever reasons) shortly before the Enabling Act was brought in. As two thirds of the representatives attending were necessary, the Act could then be passed. I do not have a source for this, this belongs to common knowledge. So, if the article tells about the Enabling Act putting up the (adventurous) theory that the vatican helped the Enabling Act in turn for the Reichskonkordat, it should as well mention these facts above, which brings the true circumstances, especially the limited powers of the ...   \n",

Hundreds of international and Canadian newspaper articles refer to the region as \"the Great Bear Rainforest.\" Businesses in the region advertise themselves using this designation and so do a number of academic publications. It is certainly within the scope of Wikipedia to provide information about how a protected region was created. The lack of specifics regarding the political fight that surrounded the eventual agreement and the dearth of information about the First Nations, eco groups, Canadian governmental agencies, businesses and residents involved is appaling. So is the lack of specifics about the flora and fauna in this region and the lack of photographs or maps.

It's debatable as to whether or not Tamiflu will help in the event of a potential human-transmittable flu virus. At any rate, the chemical synthesis is so complex at this point that there really aren't that many companies around with the equipment, capital, and expertise to make Tamiflu. Would millions die if we didn't have enough of the drug? Perhaps. But that is far from clear, and it is ridiculous to say that is Roche's fault. Eugene Kwan 04:43, 27 October (UTC)   \n",
       "29828  Indeed, if we actually did distribute shikimic acid to other companies, they wouldn't be able to produce nearly as much as Roche could. Star anise can be grown in many places, but in those four provinces, for some reason, the star anise produces it in a quantity that is high enough for economical extraction. I.E. It would go be wasted. I have heard from sources that Roche is ramping up the microbial shikimate synthesis that they have licenced and will be able to produce more tamiflu. Even so, the synthesis *starting* from shikimate involves several low-yielding and dangerous steps, including a few ones with highly explosive intermediates. wouldn't call any of the steps \"low yielding\", but it's true, they aren't terrific. I read that the whole synthesis takes something like twelve months for some reason. I'm sure it would take a long time to get all the facilities setup, anyways.

       "33401  Fair point. I knew that the team around the 1956 times only played a game or so, but when I thought about it, it still does somewhat count as a national team. I'm pretty sure they did have a manager at this time and they did play under a Croatian name so I think its worth still mentioning very briefly that a Croatian team represented the Croatian name in one friendly match with a team that was active at that time. Against who it was I dont know, I'll try to find out though. (talk) 00:22, 13 August 2008 (UTC) Great, I see that the article is also somewhat of a helping reference to the cause. At least it (slightly) clarifies the team which unofficially existed around 1918, although the management of Hugo Kinert is something I really cannot find a DIRECT reference on (would really appreciate any help on such!).

       "33402  The article says that after 1945, \"Further Croatian teams remained active until 1956, when Yugoslavia participated at the 1956 Olympic Games with a minor inclusion of Croatian participants\". This isn't really true since after WW2 only the Yugoslavia national team (which included Croatian players right from the beginning) was active. There was just a single game played in the period 1945-1990 under Croatian name, and it was just a one-off exhibition game, much like the occasional Catalonia or Basque \"national team\" games played today. There was absolutely no Croatian national team to speak of really so the sole 1956 friendly cannot be considered a continuation of the national team (there was no Croatian FA, no official manager, home kit or anything else). Furthermore, at least 5 out of 17 players at the 1956 Olympics were Croatian, so I'm not sure if that could be called \"a minor inclusion\", and Zlatko Papec (of Hajduk Split) even scored three goals for Yugoslavia.

(talk) 16:20, 13 December 2011 (UTC) This does sound poorly worded. However it should also be made clear that real text in actual use on computers usually contains so much ASCII (number, spaces, newlines, XML markup, quoted English, etc) that they are *still* shorter in UTF-8 than UTF-16. In addition it should be pointed out that most characters are entire words equivalent to 3-7 characters in English and thus they already have a huge compression advantage. Some alphabetic languages from India do have a 3-byte UTF-8 encoding of all their letters. Since their words consist of multiple characters they can end up bigger in UTF-8 than UTF-16, and there have been complaints about this. Any comment about length should mention these languages where it actually is a problem.Spitzak (talk) 21:13, 13 December 2011 (UTC)   \n",

Loads of games have been set in another country then they are developed in (such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Assassin's Creed ect.) and their articles doesn't say that are developed \"In Japan\" or \"In Canada\" after mentioning the developer so why is mentioning the country of Rockstar North in this article is important?.

Besides, the original titles for those episodes only had kana charaters. Those episodes were ment for young viewers who can't read kanji (chinese characters) and to follow the style of the Game Boy games which can't support it as the screen is too small to view the kanji clearly. Let's just end this dispute, it's been almost a week now. Everyone should just agree to either one and stick to it, though it is preferable if the episode title that's displayed in the episode itself is used. — (Talk/ノート) 15:02, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</td>\n",

       "1880   For the pseudoscience label, we're currently using this source: \"So if traditional Chinese medicine is so great, why hasn't the qualitative study of its outcomes opened the door to a flood of cures? The most obvious answer is that it actually has little to offer: it is largely just pseudoscience, with no rational mechanism of action for most of its therapies.\" This sentence is a grammatically difficult structure, and I'd like to point out that the colon connects the \"it is largely just pseudoscience\" with the \"the most obvious answer is...\".

       "2473   From what I can see, it doesn't unnecessarily complicate anything, and it adds some information. The country of development isnt actually mentioned anywhere else in the article, which is a bit strange, even though it is in that category. If there isnt a problem having something there, and it adds information, why remove it? The fact that rockstar games is american and rockstar north is british is probably new to many people, especially as all (or almost all) of the GTA series are set in america.

Loads of games have been set in another country then they are developed in (such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Assassin's Creed ect.) and their articles doesn't say that are developed \"In Japan\" or \"In Canada\" after mentioning the developer so why is mentioning the country of Rockstar North in this article is important?.

       "25830  The terms fishbelly and potbelly are a source of confusion: fishbelly refers to a convex underbelly of the butt between the toe and wrist; potbelly refers to a convex underbelly of the forearm between the wrist and the forearm tip. The M1 and M2 stocks have a fairly straight profile from toe to the pistol grip at the wrist: they do not have a noticeable fishbelly. The M1 carbine has a straight profile from wrist to forearm tip. The M2 has a noticeable potbelly profile from wrist to forearm tip. M2 stocks also have clearance cuts for the fire selector switch on the left side of the inletting for the receiver which is lacking in the M1 and M1A1 stocks (I have seen M1 and M1A1 stocks altered to accept the M2 switch). Internal inletting for the M2 \"rocker\" between the disconnector and slide is less obvious. M2 parts such as the potbelly stock were later standard replacement parts for the M1, M1A1 and M2 carbines in inventory. The M2 forearm is noticeably more robust than the M1. Naama...   \n",

I know everyone likes to think of the different dubs as different shows, but the article doesn't have two entries for syndicated Dragon Ball Z and in-house FUNI Dragon Ball Z, or even syndicated DiC Sailor Moon/Sailor Moon R and Cloverway Sailor Moon S/Sailor Moon SuperS. The other reason being at no point do any of these three entries re-tread each other's ground. I fully understand Naruto and DBZ having separate uncut listings because Toonami ran those series a second time with zero editing. The Piece uncut entry is there even though Toonami does not advertise it as such, like it has with the former two, and it is not running old episodes that had previously run edited. Piece is definitely unique in the fact that it is the only series that went unfinished on the original Toonami, and was brought back to resume on the present Toonami. So maybe there can just be two entries,...</td>\n",

       "62232  Considering the minor issue we had with IGPX's double listing, I'd like to ask why Piece has three entries. I know everyone likes to think of the different dubs as different shows, but the article doesn't have two entries for syndicated Dragon Ball Z and in-house FUNI Dragon Ball Z, or even syndicated DiC Sailor Moon/Sailor Moon R and Cloverway Sailor Moon S/Sailor Moon SuperS. The other reason being at no point do any of these three entries re-tread each other's ground. I fully understand Naruto and DBZ having separate uncut listings because Toonami ran those series a second time with zero editing. The Piece uncut entry is there even though Toonami does not advertise it as such, like it has with the former two, and it is not running old episodes that had previously run edited. Piece is definitely unique in the fact that it is the only series that went unfinished on the original Toonami, and was brought back to resume on the present Toonami. So maybe there can just be two entries,...   \n",

I know everyone likes to think of the different dubs as different shows, but the article doesn't have two entries for syndicated Dragon Ball Z and in-house FUNI Dragon Ball Z, or even syndicated DiC Sailor Moon/Sailor Moon R and Cloverway Sailor Moon S/Sailor Moon SuperS. The other reason being at no point do any of these three entries re-tread each other's ground. I fully understand Naruto and DBZ having separate uncut listings because Toonami ran those series a second time with zero editing. The Piece uncut entry is there even though Toonami does not advertise it as such, like it has with the former two, and it is not running old episodes that had previously run edited. Piece is definitely unique in the fact that it is the only series that went unfinished on the original Toonami, and was brought back to resume on the present Toonami.

       "62124  Considering the minor issue we had with IGPX's double listing, I'd like to ask why Piece has three entries. I know everyone likes to think of the different dubs as different shows, but the article doesn't have two entries for syndicated Dragon Ball Z and in-house FUNI Dragon Ball Z, or even syndicated DiC Sailor Moon/Sailor Moon R and Cloverway Sailor Moon S/Sailor Moon SuperS. The other reason being at no point do any of these three entries re-tread each other's ground. I fully understand Naruto and DBZ having separate uncut listings because Toonami ran those series a second time with zero editing. The Piece uncut entry is there even though Toonami does not advertise it as such, like it has with the former two, and it is not running old episodes that had previously run edited. Piece is definitely unique in the fact that it is the only series that went unfinished on the original Toonami, and was brought back to resume on the present Toonami.

We (and I mean we) are all still learning, and there's not much you can do that can't be undone if a mistake is made.

The Piece uncut entry is there even though Toonami does not advertise it as such, like it has with the former two, and it is not running old episodes that had previously run edited.

If that was true we'd have to mention every single thing that happens in the show if we mention some of it.Complete fabracation and nonsence! The wording describes the theme concept very well and then the joke, so one does not have to know it already to understand. It's very well written.

       "6633   I have twice deleted the following: The world over people know the song as:- DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER BATMAN!- BATMAN!- BATMAN! This has resulted in the joke, \"How does Batman's mother tell him it's time for Dinner\"?. \"Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, BATMAN!\". As the joke has now become widely told and the answer is one of the most known, an alternate response to the joke is \"Dinners ready, Batman\". I feel if we list one joke we have to list them all. And the joke is meaningless unless one is familiar with the theme song melody. We cannot assume this. Consider this a snap poll. Do you support or oppose this being included? I oppose. 14:30, 30 March 2006 (UTC) I oppose. I also boldly forged ahead, which seems especially legitimate given that the only \"support\" votes are anons. I rewrote the \"theme song\" section, giving it a more encyclopedic tone, and moved it down the page. I wasn't even aware of this vote when...   \n",

       "56335  Considering the minor issue we had with IGPX's double listing, I'd like to ask why Piece has three entries. I know everyone likes to think of the different dubs as different shows, but the article doesn't have two entries for syndicated Dragon Ball Z and in-house FUNI Dragon Ball Z, or even syndicated DiC Sailor Moon/Sailor Moon R and Cloverway Sailor Moon S/Sailor Moon SuperS. The other reason being at no point do any of these three entries re-tread each other's ground. I fully understand Naruto and DBZ having separate uncut listings because Toonami ran those series a second time with zero editing. The Piece uncut entry is there even though Toonami does not advertise it as such, like it has with the former two, and it is not running old episodes that had previously run edited. Piece is definitely unique in the fact that it is the only series that went unfinished on the original Toonami, and was brought back to resume on the present Toonami. So maybe there can just be two entries,...   \n",
